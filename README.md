### c. Analysis on the results
  First of all, codes that used in this project was executed in laptop with 6-core & 6-threads processor. Therefore, it can be expected that the best performace will be achieved when using 6 threads.
  
  First, let’s see the case of using **dynamic load balancing**. Since the dynamic load balancing assigns tasks to threads at execution time(not while programming time), the end time of each thread is alomost the same. When looking at the graph, it can be seen that the overall execution time decreases. Characteristically, it decreases rapidly until six threads are used, but there is little change thereafter. This is consistent with what we expected earlier.   
 Next, let’s see the case of using **static load balancing with block decomposition**. In static load balancing with block decomposition, assuming that the task is from 1 to 20000 and 4 threads are used, 1 to 5000 are assigned to 1st thread, and 5001 to 10000 are assigned to the 2nd thread and so on. This also shows a similar pattern to using dynamic load balancing, but the reduction in execution time is slower than dynamic. This is because the number of tasks was divided equally, not based on the execution time. In other words, the thread that finishes the task early becomes idle.
 
 Finally, this is the case using **static load balancing with cyclic decomposition**. In the case of static load balancing with cyclic decomposition, assuming that the conditions are the same as block decomposition, {4k} task is assigned to the first thread amd {4k+1} task is assigned to the second thread and so on. This case also show a decreasing trend, but slightly different. It shows a stepwise decreasing trend. It assumed that this is because it does not perform continuous tasks, but rather computations such as {4k+1} and some overhead such as context switching occurs.
 
 Overall, it is important to know the number of threads that a program can use rather than increasing the number of threads used in program. In addition, the key point is that tasks are similarly distributed to each thread based on the execution time.

### c. Analysis on the results
 First of all, codes that used in this project was executed in laptop with 6-core & 6-threads processor. Therefore, it can be expected that the best performace will be achieved when using 6 threads. This is the same as described in problem 1.
 
 Let’s say that two matrices that have to be multiplid are A and B. In order to calculate A*B using a multi-thread, the number of rows of A maix was divided by the number of threads. And then, each thread is only responsible for calculating the corresponding range. For ease of understanding, suppose two matrices, 20 rows and 20 columns, are multiplied by each other and we will use 4 thread to calculate. Then, the multiplied matrix is also 20 rows and 20 columns. At this time, the first thread is in charge of calculating lines 1 to 4 of the result matrix, and the second thread is in charge of calculating lines 5 to 8 and so on. Each thread will be performed in parallel. 
 
 Looking at the execution time graph, it may be seen that the execution time decreases as the number of threads increases. However, the execution time decreases rapidly until six threads are used, but there is no significant change after that. This is because the PC running this program is a 6-core processor.

## 2-1. Parking garage operation with ArrayBlockingQueue()
### a. Problem
Threads mean cars, and shared resources mean parking lots. It is a program that manages the access of cars that want to use a limited parking lot.

### b. Code
- [ParkingBlockingQueue.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ParkingBlockingQueue.java)

<br />

## 2-2. Parking garage operation with Semaphore()
### a. Problem
Same as 2-1.

### b. Code
- [ParkingSemaphore.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ParkingSemaphore.java)

<br />

## 2-3-1. ArrayBlockingQueue and BlockingQueue
### a. Descriptions
 ArrayBlockingQueue is a BlockingQueue that implemented with an array. The programmer sets the size when setting the queue, so it is fixed and cannot be changed. The key functions of ArrayBlockingQueue are ‘put()’ and ‘take()’. If you want to get items from the queue, you should use ‘take()’. If the queue is empty when getting a item from queue, it will wait until item is added instead of returning ‘null’. On the other side, when want to put an item in a queue, we can use ‘put()’. If the queue is full in that case, it will wait until space is available. That is, wait for some items to be removed from the queue. Also, it can be used without ‘synchronized’ in multiple thread because it guarantees concurrency safety.
 
### b. Example Code
- [ex1.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ex1.java)

## 2-3-2. ReadWriteLock
### a. Descriptions
 Mutex uses only ‘lock’ and ‘unlock’. However, this can be said to be a slightly inefficient method. For example, if one thread accesses the data protected by the lock to read, the other thread cannot read that data. Since the simple reading does not impair the consistency of the data, synchronization problems don’t occur even if multiple threads read the same data at the same time. On the other hand, ReadWriteLock has ‘readLock’ and ‘writeLock’ additionally. If one thread read some data, that data becomes read-lock state. In this case, the other threads can read that data simultaneously but cannot write. However, if one thread is writing some data, all requests(read or write) are blocked.
 
### b. Example Code
- [ex2.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ex2.java)

<br />

## 2-3-3. AtomicInteger
### a. Descriptions
 ‘AtomicInteger’ means integer that atomicity. It guarantees concurrency safety without using ‘synchronized’ keyword or ‘lock’ when modifying(or reading) the same integer variable in multithread environment. That is, it is safe from threads accssing the variable at the same time. If you want to modify or read integer value, you should use ‘set(int)’ or ‘get()’ respectively. There are many methods that can modify(or read) such as ‘getAndAdd(n)’, ‘addAndGet(n)’, ‘incrementAndGet()’, ‘getAndIncrement()’, and so on. For example, ‘getAndAdd(n)’ returns the current integer value and adds newValue(n) to the current value. 

 
### b. Example Code
- [ex3.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ex3.java)

<br />

## 2-3-3. CyclicBarrier
### a. Descriptions
 ‘CyclicBarrier’ makes it wait at a desired point inside the runnig thread. And if the program call ‘await()’ as much as the value that passes as a parameter to the constructor, the program can release the waiting of all waiting threads.

 
### b. Example Code
- [ex4.java](https://github.com/jhyoon9705/22-01-Multicore_computing/blob/main/ex4.java)
